DEFINING THE USE CASES



*side notes
  - RRAC = Requirements, Risks, Assumptions, and Constraints
  - Requirements is really what the system MUST DO - what it must achieve at the end of the day!
  - Risks, Assumptions and Constraints => this is what further defines that the requirements can or can not be!
