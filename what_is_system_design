a process of defining the following key situations:
1. the elements of a system
2. the interactions and relationships of these elements

THE AIM OF THIS PROCESS IS TO SATISFY A SET OF SPECIFIED REQUIREMENTS
*there are two categories of these requirements
  1. functional requirements
  2. non-functional requirements

*note that SATISFY is an important keyword. 

A system is defined, and consequently designed to SATISFY a set of specified requirements.


It involves taking a problem statement, 
  break it down into smaller components, 
  and designing each component to work together effectively 
  to achieve the overall goal of the system.

The system design process typically includes
    analyzing the current system - if any
    determining any deficiencies
    creating a detailed plan for the new system
    testing the design to ensure that it meets the requirements

IT IS AN ITERATIVE PROCESS THAT MAY INVOLVE MANY ROUNDS OF DESIGN, TESTING AND REFINEMENT

System Design is actually a phase in a software development process.
    it focuses on high-level design of a software system - including the architecture and its components.

A GOOD SYSTEM DESIGN ENGINEER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE FOLLOWING:
    1. understand a given problem statement
    2. come up with a detailed design of a system that solves that problem statement
    3. understand and be able to discuss the following of the suggested sytem
        - ARCHITECTURE
        - COMPONENTS
        - INTERACTIONS
        - TRADE-OFFs involved in the design
        - ALTERNATIVES considered


THEREFORE, SYSTEM DESIGN = Architecture + Components + Interactions + Trade-Offsree download Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
