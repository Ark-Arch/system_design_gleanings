approach to designing a system

RRAC - Requirements Risks Assumptions and Constraints

*Scalability is the 4th step of the system design process.

1. Understand what the problem is -RRAC. rewquirement, risk, assumptions and constraints
2. identify the scope of the problem
3. research and analyze existing systems. look at what is similar, and identify what worked well and did not.
4. create a high-


THE SYSTEM DESIGN PROCESS
1. DEFINE THE CONSTRAINTS AND THE USE CASES OF THE SYSTEM 
  It is very important to gather the requirements of the system.
