approach to designing a system

RRAC - Requirements Risks Assumptions and Constraints

*Scalability is the 4th step of the system design process.

1. Understand what the problem is -RRAC. rewquirement, risk, assumptions and constraints
2. identify the scope of the problem
3. research and analyze existing systems. look at what is similar, and identify what worked well and did not.
4. create a high-level design: outline the main components of the sytsem and how they will interact with each other.
    this should include a rough diagram of the system's architecture
5. refine the design
    work on the details of the design, iterate and refine it until theres a complete and detailed design that meets all the requirements.

6. Document the design

7. continously monitor and improve the system


THE SYSTEM DESIGN PROCESS
1. DEFINE THE CONSTRAINTS AND THE USE CASES OF THE SYSTEM 
  It is very important to gather the requirements of the system.
   clarify the constraints of the system
   identify the use cases the system would need to satisfy.

    DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE SYSTEM - and its boundaries.
